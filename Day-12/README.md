This is a program that implements the a number guessing game

The computer chooses a random number between `1 - 100`

The user chooses a difficulty

> for `hard` difficulty the user has a maximum of 5 guesses
> for `easy` difficulty the user has a maximum of 10 guesses

The user inputs a guess

The user guess is compared to the computer chosen value

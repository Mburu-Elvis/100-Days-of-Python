# 100-Days-of-Python

---

A 100 days of python challenge

## Day 1

I've read about variables and variable naming rules
I've learnt about strings and string manipulations
I've implemented `day 1's band name generator` project

## Day 2

Learnt about:-

- Data types
- Type Conversions
- Mathematical operators

### Day 2 Projects

#### a. your_life_in_weeks

A project to calculate a person's remaining time to live given that the life span is `90 years`
It's implemented in the `your_life_span_in_weeks.py` file

It return the remaining time in:-

- weeks
- months
- years

***Concepts used in implementation***

- input function to take user input
- type conversion
- mathematical operations to calculate the remaining time
- printing the remaining time to the `standard output`

#### b. Tip_Calculator

A program that calculates the total bill paid by each person, tip inclusive

It's implemented in the `Tip_Calculator.py` file

***Concepts used in implementation***

- getting user input
- type casting user input
- mathematical operations to get the total bill
- print total bill by each person

### Day 2 Projects

#### a. your_life_in_weeks

A project to calculate a person's remaining time to live given that the life span is `90 years`
It's implemented in the `your_life_span_in_weeks.py` file

It return the remaining time in:-

- weeks
- months
- years

***Concepts used in implementation***

- input function to take user input
- type conversion
- mathematical operations to calculate the remaining time
- printing the remaining time to the `standard output`

#### b. Tip_Calculator

A program that calculates the total bill paid by each person, tip inclusive

It's implemented in the `Tip_Calculator.py` file

***Concepts used in implementation***

- getting user input
- type casting user input
- mathematical operations to get the total bill
- print total bill by each person

### Day-3 Projects

Learnt about `if-elif-else` statement

#### a. roller_coaster

implemented in `roller_coaster.py`

A roller coaster ticketer

A program that checks a persons eligiblity to ride the roller coater
if eligible it calculates the total bill for a person depending on age and preferences

#### b. pizza_order

implemented in `pizza_order.py`

A program that calculates the price for a pizza

The price is determined by the size, pepperoni and extra cheese preferences

#### c. BMI Calculator

implemented in `BMI_calculator.py`
